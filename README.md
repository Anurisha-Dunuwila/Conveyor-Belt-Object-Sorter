#  Conveyor belt with Object Sorting using Image Processing

This project includes the design and fabrication of a conveyor belt system integrated with object sorting and counting capabilities. Utilizing mechatronics principles, image processing techniques, and modern technology, we've developed a system capable of sorting onions and potatoes efficiently. Our system employs Raspberry Pi 3 Model B as the controlling board and uses Python programming for code development. The conveyor belt is equipped with various sensors and actuators, including proximity sensors, Pi Camera V2 module, Ultrasonic sensor, MG90S Metal Gear Micro Servo, linear actuator, and a DC gear motor. 

The system achieves precise object sorting and counting by combining these components and leveraging **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services** for image classification.
